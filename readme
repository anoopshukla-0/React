Reflecting on the differences between traditional DOM manipulation and React's approach:

React's declarative approach allows developers to describe the desired state of the UI, rather than imperatively manipulating the DOM.
With React, you work with components and manage their state, which leads to more modular and maintainable code compared to directly manipulating the DOM.
React efficiently updates only the components that have changed, optimizing performance.
React's virtual DOM helps in efficiently updating the actual DOM, reducing the need for manual optimizations.
